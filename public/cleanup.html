<h1>"Clean up Your Community" Project</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>LitterBug is a mobile app in early development. Born from the ANU TechLauncher program and commissioned by Deloitte
    Digital, it aims to tackle the challenge of efficient resource allocation for litter cleanup. Incomplete and
    inaccurate litter location data often hampers these efforts, prompting LitterBug an app that utilises crowdsourcing
    and gamification to solve this issue all while involving young people in cleaning their community.<br />
    In the first semester, we conducted primary user research and secondary research. This informed our understanding of
    stakeholder perspectives, problem intricacies, competitor insights, and user needs. During the second semester we
    successfully implemented an MVP, allowing users to report litter, view locations on a map, and compete on
    leaderboards.
